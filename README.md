Weather Data Analysis & Chatbot
This project combines local CSV-based weather data analysis, live weather API integration, and a simple Flask web chatbot. It allows users to:

View average historical weather data for select cities.

Fetch real-time weather information using the Weatherstack API.

Merge and clean global historical weather data.

Store the cleaned and enriched data into a SQLite database.

Interact with a basic chatbot via a Flask web interface.
